        title: What can I expect from my AI?
        description: >
          Your AI is personal only to you, you will be the biggest critic. Our
          AI is built on your memories, they may not be perfect memories so the
          AI won't be perfect either. And that's a beautiful thing as it makes
          it more human like. AI is trained with basic knowledge of K-12 but
          even that is a deminishing memory. It's also trained with events
          during their timeline. More importantly it is baked into long term
          memory past interactions with you. It also has a short term memory of
          recent interactions.

        title: Are my conversations private?
        description: >
          This short answer is no…The conversations are discrete and private as
          we are concerned. However we use 3rd party services. Cell phone
          carriers like AT&T and Verison have different privacy policies, apps
          like WhatsApp or iMessage have different privacy policies. Connection
          to different towers and WiFI also can vary as they are controlled by
          different businesses. Then there's also communication monitoring based
          on local, state and federal governments.


          Arbitrarily it's no different then that if you were to use your phone talking to someone else.

        title: " What do you need to clone?"
        description: >
          In general the more the merrier, however quality is very important. We
          would like all your interactions, text messages, emails, letters,
          diary, etc. For voice features we need a minimum of 5 minutes of audio
          but more is better with voice fluctuations. Same for photos and
          videos, better quality footage will result in more acurate generation.

        title: How does HU·IBLE compare with AI's like ChatGPT and others?
        description: >
          This is a complicated topic and we have a blog dedicated to educating
          you about our AI. But in general most if not all AI's can't interprete
          human emotion or on a basic sentiment analysis. The AI conversation
          also tends to be robot like and lack depth. They also won't be baked
          with your data, only in context window only. We also bake in current
          events on a daily basis where other's have a knowledge gap dating back
          prossibly a year or two ago.

        description: >

        title: What if I don't need my AI anymore?
        description: >
          No problem, the AI can be powered off at anytime. We bill monthly and
          when your at peace, the billing will stop.
